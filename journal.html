			<h2>Monday, April 15, 2013</h2>
				<p>I can't put into words how EXCITED I am that classes have started and are just as awesome as I imagined!</p>
				<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/110d7482e882f420a619fa68b5f3b4b8/tumblr_inline_mijucdXBzb1qz4rgp.gif" /></p>
				<p>Web design is something I've been interested in since the glory days of Xanga and MySpace when I would spend many a night forgoing my pre-algebra for making flashy profiles full of gifs (yes, they existed back then), busy backdrops, and angst-ridden quotations.</p>
				<p>And to be honest, as the 2-year anniversary of my college graduation draws closer and closer, I really simply miss being in school.</p>
				<p>I absolutely <em>thrive</em> in stressful situations, which is why I like to keep my plate full. The most important thing you must know about me, is that I never (and I mean <em>never</em>) have just one job.</p>
				<p>I'm currently working in social media at the Chicago History Museum, and on the side I run my own jewelry business <a href="http://rustedrevolution.com/">Rusted Revolution</a> and write on the reg for Choose Chicago's <em>Chicago Like a Local</em> blog.</p>
				<p>Luckily, my life has slowed down a minuscule fraction of a bit, so I'm filling up all that spare time with HTML/CSS and Visual Design classes.</p>
				<p>I can't wait to start cramming my brain with information and letting all my creative juices flow.</p>
				<p>And of course, I hope to make some new friends along the way. So hi.</p>

				<p>-Starter League Admissions welcome e-mail</p>
				<p>I was told to, and so I shall.</p>
				<p>Except I won't be using WordPress or Tumblr. I'm going to build my own blog, the Starter way.</p>
